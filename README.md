In the Pig dice game, players take turns rolling a single six-sided die. On each turn, a player can choose to roll the die as many times as they wish, adding the result of each roll (except for a 1) to their running total for that turn. However, if the player rolls a 1 at any point during their turn, their entire turn's progress is lost, and the turn passes to the next player. To avoid this risk, a player can choose to "hold" their accumulated points for the turn and pass the turn to the next player. The first player to reach a predetermined target score, such as 100 points, wins the game.
